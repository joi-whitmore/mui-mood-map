# MUI Mood Map

Welcome to the **MUI Mood Map**! This project is a mood-based task prioritizer designed to help users manage their tasks by aligning them with their current mood or energy level. This app allows users to input tasks and filter them based on their current mood, helping them to prioritize what best fits their mindset.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a title, description, and type (e.g., Creative, Focused, Energized).
- **Mood Selection**: Select your current mood (e.g., Energized, Focused, Creative, Tired) to see tasks that fit best with that mood.
- **Task Filtering**: Tasks are filtered based on your mood to help you decide which to tackle, depending on how you feel.
- **Dark Mode Support**: The app features a dark mode design with mood-based button colors.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are persisted using JSON Server, ensuring they stay even if the page is refreshed.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Users can check off tasks as completed, which applies a strikethrough effect to the text.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Material UI**: For UI components and theming.
- **JSON Server**: To simulate a backend server and persist tasks data.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the JSON Server.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **Git** for version control.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joi-whitmore/mui-mood-map.git
   cd mui-mood-map
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start JSON Server**

   To run the JSON server that persists the tasks:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 5001
   ```

   Make sure the `db.json` file is in the root directory of your project. The server will run at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

4. **Start the React Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Usage Instructions

- **Add Task**: Use the "Task Title", "Task Description", and "Task Type" fields to create a new task, then click "Add Task".
- **Select Mood**: Choose your current mood (Energized, Focused, Creative, Tired) to filter tasks.
- **Complete Task**: Check off a task to mark it as completed.

## Folder Structure

- **`/src`**: Contains all React code for the components.
- **`/components`**: Components such as `MoodSelector`, `TaskInput`, and `ToDoList` are in this folder.
- **`db.json`**: A simple JSON file used to persist task data via JSON Server.

## Available Endpoints

The JSON server runs at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001), and the following endpoints are available:

- **GET** `/tasks`: Fetch all tasks.
- **POST** `/tasks`: Add a new task.
- **PATCH** `/tasks/:id`: Update a specific task.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow different users to maintain their own task lists.
- **Task History and Analytics**: Track completed tasks and provide insights such as most productive moods or common task types.
- **Drag-and-Drop Task Ordering**: Allow users to manually reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Notifications**: Add reminder notifications for upcoming or overdue tasks.
